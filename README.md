# **BMW Click and Collect** 














## **Table of Contents**









## **Introduction**
Welcome to my third project, which is a command-line user interface application built mainly using python.

What inspired me to build this app was having the motivation to independently create an idea, put it 
together and make it work. This idea also came from the love and interest I have for BMW cars. At 
the planning phase of my third project I was unsure of what I was going to build which made very challenging as well as being a novice using python. However, I stayed motivated and focused and created this project which I learned a lot from and it has helped me to gain more experience and skills with the python language. 

In this README I will detail the steps I took to develop and create this project, with the use of  screen photos, images, links, charts and more.

Thank you for viewing my project.

I hope you find the application useful!

### **Site owner goals**
- As the site owner I would like an automated click and collect which enables the users to easily place an order and collect at the location nearest them. 
- As the site owner I would like an application to provide clear instructions for making an easy ordering process for the users. 
- As the site owner I would like an applcation to be able to perform the click and collect process successfully with little or no employee input to allow employees to focus on larger scaled jobs. 


### **How to use**
This BMW click and collect app, is used for making car orders and getting them prepared for collection at your nearest
store in your current town or city. To use this app, you need to follow the instructions on the screen and
fill out the input fields with the information needed in the correct format. The app will provide the list of cars available for you to choose from as well as, alerting you with messages if you enter invalid data in the input fields. Once you are happy with your choice of car and you have successfully completed your order. The app provides a detailed message on what you need to do for the collection process.

## **Technologies Used**

- [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language))
    - This was the main tool used to build this project.

### **Frameworks and Tools**
- [patorjk](https://patorjk.com/software/taag/#p=display&f=ANSI%20Shadow&t=BMW%20CLICK%20AND%20COLLECT)
    - This was used to create the logo for the application that is displayed to the users in the terminal.
- [ASCII Art Generator](https://asciiart.club/)
    - This was used to convert the image of a BMW car in text (ASCII art), which is displayed below the logo in the terminal.
- [Colorama](https://pypi.org/project/colorama/)
    - This was installed and imported to apply a red background to warning messages, when ever users enters invalid data into the input fields.
- [Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/landing?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=_chart_en_tier1_mixed_search_brand_exact_&km_CPC_CampaignId=1490375427&km_CPC_AdGroupID=55688909257&km_CPC_Keyword=lucidchart&km_CPC_MatchType=e&km_CPC_ExtensionID=&km_CPC_Network=g&km_CPC_AdPosition=&km_CPC_Creative=442433236001&km_CPC_TargetID=kwd-33511936169&km_CPC_Country=9045685&km_CPC_Device=c&km_CPC_placement=&km_CPC_target=&gclid=Cj0KCQjwgO2XBhCaARIsANrW2X3bXE7BqWPDkzDIXS4AFQGgJwkcG8yWrLUkoUtT7-FWVojw5AIchkEaArzYEALw_wcB)
    - This was used in the planning phase of the project to create a web-base diagram, which explains how the application would work.
- [Python Tutor](https://pythontutor.com/)
    - This was used to help with the understanding of the python language, by visualizing code execution.
- [Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/)
    - This was used to store data sent from python via an application programming interface.
- [PEP8 Python Validator](http://pep8online.com/)
    - This was used to check the python code for any errors or warnings.
- [Heroku](https://heroku.com/)
    - This was used to deploy this application.
- [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/)
    - This was the development environment used to build this project.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
    - This is a version control system which I used to handle my project throughout the development stages, to save and push my work from gitpod to github.
- [Github](http://github.com/)
    - This was used to store my project after it was saved and pushed from gitpod.

## **Testing**
This project was testing manually by using the following methods:
- The PEP8 python validator was used to test the python code for this project and there were no errors, warnings or potential problems within the project.
